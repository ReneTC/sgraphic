# SG - simple graphics
### Very simple 2d graphics package
basicly just a wrapper of the brilliant skia python package
packae exist because i needed a simple 2d graphic plotter with ipython support and matplotlib inspired syntax
p5py is close but it is slow and does not support anti-aliasing yet
SG can't do a lot yet but it is simple and fast.

Does not support interaction or 3d.

## Comming:
 - Animation support
 - Documentation
 - Examples
